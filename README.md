# Simple ZIP Cracker
  
This cracker was scripted by me and is not really complex. I do not plan to continue working on it as there's tons of other crackers already in the internet and I'm also trying to work on DraxPloit Grabber which you might wanna check out ;)  

## Instructions
1. Install the latest [Python](https://www.python.org) version
2. Download the "**Simple ZIP Cracker v1.0**" release (click [here](https://github.com/DraxFM/Simple-ZIP-Cracker/releases/download/manually/Simple-ZIP-Cracker.zip))
3. Run the **cracker.py** file

## Usage
When trying to crack a **.zip** file, please remember to have the wordlist but also the target **.zip** file in the same path as the **cracker.py** file is laying in!  
When running the main file the rest is pretty self explanatory.

## Explanation
This file does not contain any malicious code. You can open the **cracker.py** using Python and see for yourself.
