# Simple ZIP Cracker v1.0
  
This cracker was scripted by me and is not really complex. I do not plan to continue working on it as there's tons of other crackers already in the internet and I'm also trying to work on DraxPloit Grabber which you might wanna check out ;)  

In the release there is a "**badWordlist.txt**" which is a wordlist I wrote just for demonstration. The same with the "**secret.zip**". It's an example file to test my program. Will you be able to crack it open and find the contents of it (there actually are)?

## Instructions
1. Install the latest [Python](https://www.python.org) version.
2. Download the "**Simple ZIP Cracker v1.0**" release (click [here](https://github.com/DraxFM/Simple-ZIP-Cracker/releases/download/manually/Simple-ZIP-Cracker.zip)).
3. Extract the "**Simple-ZIP-Cracker.zip**" file. You can delete it afterwards.
4. Open the extracted folder and run the **cracker.py** file.

## Usage
When trying to crack a **.zip** file, please remember to have the wordlist but also the target **.zip** file in the same path as the "**cracker.py**" file is laying in!  
  
Also be sure to add the file extensions when giving input to the **cracker.py** console. Let's say we use the example given in the release. The file you want to crack is not "**secret**", it's "**secret.zip**". The wordlist that will be used is not "**badWordlist**" but "**badWordlist.txt**". If you do not add the file extensions the program will not be able to find the dedicated file and thus will not crack the ZIP!  
  
When running the main file the rest is pretty self explanatory.

## Explanation
This file does not contain any malicious code. You can open the **cracker.py** using Python and see for yourself.
